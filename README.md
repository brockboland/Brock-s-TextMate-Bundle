I use TextMate. Constantly. It's the one app only quits when I need to shutdown.

I realized that some of my TextExpander snippets would make more sense as snippets in TextMate, since that's the only place I use them. Right now, I've only got the one, but I'll be adding more as I find more things I can wrap up into snippets and stuff.
